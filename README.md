# Reactr Category Images

This is a WordPress plugin intended that can be used alongside Reactr-based themes, including WPRealEstate, ShowThemes, Imagely, Photocrati.

It adds featured images to categories. 

When creating or editing categories, a new option will show that allows you to upload an image or select one from the media library. This image will be used as the featured image on category pages. For example, if you have your theme configured to display featured images in the page header, then you will see the the category's featured image in the page header on category pages. 

## Getting Started

Down the zip from github. Upload to your WordPress install via the plugins page and activate. No build steps are required.
